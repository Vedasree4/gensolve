# Bezier Curve Fitting and Shape Detection

## Description
This script reads a CSV file with point coordinates, fits a Bezier curve to the points, detects various shapes, and outputs results as both a plot and an SVG file.
## Prerequisites
### For code1
Before running the code-1, you need to install the following Python packages:

- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **mpld3**: For converting Matplotlib figures to interactive D3.js HTML.

#### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required packages using `pip`. Run the following command in Google colab:

```bash
!pip install numpy matplotlib mpld3
```

### For code2&3
Before running the code, you need to install the following Python packages:

- **pandas**: For reading CSV files and data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scipy**: For spline interpolation and curve fitting.
- **shapely**: For geometric operations and shape detection.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **svgpathtools**: For generating SVG files from curves.

#### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required packages using `pip`. Run the following command in Google colab:

```bash
!pip install pandas numpy scipy shapely matplotlib svgpathtools
```
